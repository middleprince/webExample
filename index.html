    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>

    <h2>Founders</h2>
    <p>
      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
      technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take
      command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
      everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
      <strong>We believe there are at least a billion people who can benefit from
      learning technical sophistication, probably more.</strong>To join our
      movement, sign up for our official email list now.

      HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
      Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
      share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.
